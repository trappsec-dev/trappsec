## **Your code is now a security sensor** 

**trappsec** is an open-source library that helps developers catch attackers probing their APIs. By adding decoy APIs and parameters into your codebase, we can turn attacker reconnaissance into actionable security telemetry.

> Built for the 1% of people who actually look at their security alerts, **and** the 99% who just like the idea of having them — based on the radical idea that if you can’t reduce your attack surface, expand it.

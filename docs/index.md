# **turn apps into traps**

Trappsec is an open-source application-layer deception framework that helps developers catch attackers probing their APIs. It provides simple deception primitives to confirm malicious intent while blending into your codebase. It places a high value on the ability to attribute attacks to specific identities. With alerts that include intent and attribution, security teams can respond more effectively to attacks.
